//! Content storage as fixed-size, independently-sealed blocks.
//!
//! A regular file's data is split into [`CHUNK_SIZE`] logical chunks. Each
//! chunk is stored as its own file on the backing store, sealed by
//! [`crate::vault`] (encryption + integrity + Reed-Solomon ECC). This block
//! layout is the core of the redesign and buys several properties at once:
//!
//! * **No random writes into existing objects.** A block is always written
//!   whole — buffered, then atomically renamed into place. Backends that
//!   can only replace an object wholesale (S3/`rclone mount`, and the like)
//!   never see a sub-object overwrite. A partial write read-modify-writes a
//!   single ≤1 MiB block, not the whole file.
//!
//! * **Cheap incremental backup.** A block's filename is a stable keyed
//!   hash of `(content_id, block_index)`, so editing one region of a large
//!   file rewrites exactly one block file and leaves every other block
//!   byte-for-byte identical. `rsync`/`rclone` copying the data directory
//!   transfer only the changed blocks.
//!
//! * **Small + large files both behave.** A tiny file is a single small
//!   block file; a huge file is many independent block files that can be
//!   written and verified in parallel.
//!
//! * **Per-block error correction.** Bit rot in one block is recovered from
//!   that block's parity shards and never spreads to the rest of the file.
