# Set Up SMTP / Email

Services that send email (notifications, password resets, invites) need SMTP configuration. The standard StartOS pattern offers three modes: disabled (no email), system (uses the StartOS system SMTP if configured), and custom (user provides their own SMTP server). The SDK provides built-in constructs for the entire flow.

## Solution

Add the SDK's built-in `smtpShape` to your store.json file model. Create a `manageSmtp` action using `sdk.Action.withInput()` with `Value.smtpComposite()` — this provides the standard three-mode UI (disabled/system/custom). In `setupOnInit`, default SMTP to disabled. In `setupMain`, read the SMTP config and pass credentials as environment variables or write them to the app's config file.
