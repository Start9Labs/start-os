# Architecture

## Multi-Book Design

The site is composed of independent mdBook instances — one per product. Each book has its own `book.toml`, `src/SUMMARY.md`, and content tree. Books build into subdirectories of `docs/` (the build output, gitignored) and are deployed together under a shared domain.

Since this is now part of the `start-os` monorepo, the per-product books live **next to the code they document**, not inside this directory. This `docs/` project owns only the build infra, the shared theme, the landing page, and the Bitcoin Guides book.

```
start-os/ (monorepo root)
├── projects/start-os/docs/        ← StartOS book (book.toml, src/, theme -> ../../start-docs/theme)
├── projects/start-tunnel/docs/    ← StartTunnel book
├── projects/start-sdk/docs/       ← Service Packaging book (book name: "packaging")
└── projects/start-docs/           ← THIS project: site build + landing + bitcoin-guides
    ├── build.sh          ← builds all books into docs/ output
    ├── serve.sh          ← build + local dev server
    ├── versions.conf     ← book → version list (single source of truth)
    ├── theme/            ← shared theme (CSS, JS, favicon); books symlink here
    ├── landing/          ← static landing page at docs.start9.com/
    ├── scripts/          ← build-time tooling (llms.txt generator)
    └── bitcoin-guides/   ← Bitcoin Guides book
        ├── book.toml
        ├── theme -> ../theme
        └── src/ (SUMMARY.md, README.md, archival-vs-pruned.md, electrum-servers.md, ...)
```

This multi-book design was chosen over a single monolithic book because:
- Each product gets its own sidebar, search, and URL namespace
- Adding a new product means adding a book directory + one `versions.conf` line, not restructuring existing content
- Books share a flat page layout (all pages directly in `src/`) with sidebar section headers (`# Part Title` in `SUMMARY.md`)

## Book name → source dir mapping

`build.sh` decouples the book name (used in URLs and `versions.conf`) from its source directory:

```sh
book_dir() {
  case "$1" in
    start-os) echo "$ROOT/../start-os/docs" ;;
    start-tunnel) echo "$ROOT/../start-tunnel/docs" ;;
    packaging) echo "$ROOT/../start-sdk/docs" ;;
    *) echo "$ROOT/$1" ;;            # bitcoin-guides etc. live in docs/
  esac
}
```

So `packaging` is served from `projects/start-sdk/docs`, and any book not explicitly mapped (currently just `bitcoin-guides`) is expected to live directly under this project (`projects/start-docs/`). To move or add a book, edit `book_dir()` and `versions.conf`.

## Shared Theme

`theme/` in this project is the single source of truth for styling. Each book symlinks to it (e.g. `bitcoin-guides/theme -> ../theme`, `start-os/docs/theme -> ../../start-docs/theme`). It includes:
- YouTube embed styling (`youtube.css` / `youtube.js`)
- mdbook-tabs CSS/JS (`tabs.css` / `tabs.js`)
- Theme toggle (`theme-toggle.js`) and home link (`home-link.js`)
- Favicon

Each book's `book.toml` references these under `additional-css` / `additional-js`.

## Versioning

Each book is versioned independently via `versions.conf` in this project:

```
start-os=0.4.0.x
start-tunnel=1.0.x
packaging=0.4.0.x
bitcoin-guides=1.0.x
```

`versions.conf` is the single source of truth — `build.sh`, the deploy workflow, and the generated nginx config all derive from it. Adding a book takes one line here (plus a `book_dir()` mapping if it lives outside this project).

Build output goes to `docs/<book>/<version>/` (e.g. `docs/start-os/0.4.0.x/`). `MDBOOK_OUTPUT__HTML__SITE_URL` is set per-book at build time so mdBook generates correct search indexes and canonical URLs for the versioned path.

## Build Pipeline

`build.sh`:
1. Wipes and recreates the `docs/` output dir
2. Iterates over `versions.conf`, resolves each book's source dir via `book_dir()`, and runs `mdbook build -d docs/<book>/<version>` with the versioned `SITE_URL`
3. Writes a redirect stub `docs/<book>/index.html` → `/<book>/<version>/`
4. Copies `landing/index.html` to `docs/index.html`

CI then runs the llms.txt generator (`scripts/generate-llms-txt.ts`) to produce `llms.txt` (index) and `llms-full.txt` (full content) for LLM consumption.

## Deployment

Deployment is via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml` at the monorepo root). It triggers on pushes to `master` touching `projects/start-docs/**`, `projects/start-os/docs/**`, `projects/start-tunnel/docs/**`, or `projects/start-sdk/docs/**`. Steps:

1. Install mdBook (v0.5.2) and mdbook-tabs (0.3.4)
2. `./build.sh`, then generate llms.txt in `scripts/`
3. For each `versions.conf` entry, rsync `docs/<book>/<version>/` to the VPS at `/var/www/html/docs.start9.com/`
4. rsync the landing page and global llms.txt files
5. Generate `book_versions.conf` (nginx map config) from `versions.conf` and upload it to `/etc/nginx/includes/`
6. Reload nginx

The nginx site configs are fully generic — they contain no book names. The book list is controlled entirely by the generated `book_versions.conf`. Unversioned URLs (e.g. `/start-os/`) resolve to the latest version via nginx maps; a `?version=` query param can override this for linking to a specific version.

The VPS is reached over SSH using the `WEBSITE_DEPLOY_KEY` GitHub Actions secret.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/generate-llms-txt.ts` | Produces `llms.txt` (index) and `llms-full.txt` (full content) for LLM consumption |

Run via `cd scripts && npm run generate-llms-txt` (uses `tsx`).

## Cross-Book Links

mdBook validates links only within a single book. Links between books use unversioned absolute paths (`/start-tunnel/devices.html`) — nginx redirects these to the latest versioned path. They are not validated at build time, so keep them few and correct.
