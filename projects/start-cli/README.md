# start-cli

`start-cli` is the command-line client for StartOS. It is a thin `bin` crate over
[`start-core`](../../shared-libs/crates/start-core) (the shared Rust backend, crate `start-core`,
lib name `start_core`). The CLI surfaces the same RPC API the StartOS server exposes, plus
local developer tooling for building and signing `.s9pk` packages.

Most subcommands are *remote* calls: you point `start-cli` at a running StartOS server
(`--host`/`-H`) and it invokes the server's RPC API over HTTPS. A handful of commands
(`s9pk`, `init-key`, `pubkey`, `util`) run locally and are what package authors use day to day.

## Quickstart

Build the binary from the monorepo root:

```sh
cargo build -p start-cli --bin start-cli           # debug
cargo build -p start-cli --bin start-cli --release # release
```

Run it:

```sh
target/debug/start-cli --help

# talk to a server
target/debug/start-cli -H https://server.local auth login
target/debug/start-cli -H https://server.local package list

# local developer tooling (no server needed)
target/debug/start-cli init-key                    # create a developer key
target/debug/start-cli pubkey                       # print its public key
target/debug/start-cli s9pk pack ...                # build a package
```

> In a StartOS image, `start-cli` is provided as a symlink to the multiplexed
> `startbox` binary (see the OS `Makefile`), so it is always on the server's `PATH`.

## Connecting to a server

`-H/--host` accepts either a URL (`https://server.local`) or a `host` profile name
defined in a workspace `.startos/config.yaml`. Common flags:

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-H, --host <url\|profile>` | Target server URL or config profile |
| `--registry <url\|profile>` | Target registry for `registry` commands |
| `--proxy <url>` | HTTP/SOCKS proxy for outbound requests |
| `--cookie-path <path>` | Where the session cookie is stored |
| `--developer-key-path <path>` | Developer signing key location |
| `--insecure` | Skip TLS verification (testing only) |

Configuration is layered: explicit flags override `.startos/config.yaml` (local workspace),
which overrides `/etc/startos/config.yaml`. See
[`shared-libs/crates/start-core/src/context/config.rs`](../../shared-libs/crates/start-core/src/context/config.rs).

## Command surface

The full command tree comes from `start-core::main_api()`. Top-level groups include:

- `server`, `package`, `net`, `auth`, `db`, `ssh`, `wifi`, `disk`,
  `notification`, `backup`, `diagnostic`, `init`, `setup`, `kiosk` — server management (remote).
- `registry`, `tunnel` — operate against a registry / StartTunnel server.
- `s9pk`, `init-key`, `pubkey`, `util` — local packaging/dev tooling.
- `echo`, `state`, `git-info` — diagnostics.

Run `start-cli <group> --help` for any group.

## Features

Cargo features forward to `start-core`: `beta`, `console`, `dev`, `test`, `unstable`.
None are enabled by default.
