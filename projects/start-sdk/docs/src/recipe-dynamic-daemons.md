# Create Dynamic Daemons

Some services need a variable number of daemons based on user configuration — one per tunnel, one per website, one per connected node. The daemon chain is built at runtime from a config list.

## Solution

Read a variable-length list from a file model in `setupMain()`, then loop over entries to build the daemon chain with `.addDaemon()`. All dynamic daemons can share a single subcontainer image. The daemon ID must be unique per entry — derive it from the entry's data. An alternative approach generates dynamic config files (e.g., nginx server blocks) from the list and runs a single daemon serving all entries.

Building the chain inside `setupMain` rebuilds **every** daemon whenever the list changes (a reactive `.const(effects)` read re-runs `setupMain`). When sub-instances are added, renamed, or removed at runtime and you don't want to bounce the unaffected ones, use **`sdk.Daemons.dynamic()`** instead — it reconciles the running set against a freshly-built one, touching only what actually changed.

```typescript
import { sdk } from './sdk'
import { tunnelsFile } from './fileModels/tunnels.json'

// `main` IS the reconciler — no `setupMain` wrapper.
export const main = sdk.Daemons.dynamic(async ({ effects }) => {
  // Re-runs whenever the watched file changes (a constRetry trigger).
  const tunnels = (await tunnelsFile.read().const(effects)) ?? []

  let daemons = sdk.Daemons.of(effects)
  for (const t of tunnels) {
    daemons = daemons.addDaemon(`tunnel-${t.id}`, {
      // Must be a LAZY SubContainer (`.of`, not `.eager`): the reconciler
      // rejects eager handles, and lazy ones are never materialized for
      // daemons that diff to "leave alone".
      subcontainer: sdk.SubContainer.of(
        effects,
        { imageId: 'tunnel' },
        sdk.Mounts.of(),
        `tunnel-${t.id}`,
      ),
      exec: { command: ['tunnel', '--port', String(t.port)] },
      requires: [],
    })
  }
  return daemons // return the record-mode chain — do NOT call `.build()`.
})
```

On each run the reconciler diffs entries by `id` and a `configHash` of their structural fields (`imageId`, `sharedRun`, `name`, `mounts`, `exec`, `requires`, and `ready`'s `display`/`gracePeriod`):

- **absent → present** — start the new daemon
- **present → absent** — stop the removed daemon
- **same `configHash`** — leave it running, untouched
- **different `configHash`** — restart it

Dependents (via `requires`) of any restarted or stopped daemon restart too, so the wiring stays consistent. Closures — `ready.fn`, `ready.trigger`, a function-form `exec.fn` — are **not** part of the hash, so surface anything the reconciler must react to through one of the hashed fields.
