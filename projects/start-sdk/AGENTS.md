# AGENTS.md — start-sdk

The TypeScript SDK (`@start9labs/start-sdk`) for building StartOS service packages. Lives at `projects/start-sdk/` inside the start-os monorepo. Two npm packages plus the packaging build wrapper and the packaging mdbook. `CLAUDE.md` is a one-line `@AGENTS.md` import. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for structure and contribution details.

**Read up the tree first.** These docs are hierarchical: before working here, read the `AGENTS.md` in each enclosing directory up to the repo root (and their `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` where relevant). This file covers only what is specific to this scope and does not repeat rules already stated higher up.

## Layout

- `base/` — `@start9labs/start-sdk-base`: core types, OS bindings, ABI, `Effects`, ExVer parser, actions/input builders, interfaces, dependencies, s9pk reader. No dependency on the package layer. Source in `base/lib/`.
- `package/` — `@start9labs/start-sdk`: developer-facing facade (`StartSdk`), daemons, health checks, backups, file helpers, subcontainers, i18n, triggers. Re-exports base. Source in `package/lib/`.
- `baseDist/` / `dist/` — build outputs (generated; `dist/` is what publishes to npm). **Web and container-runtime consume the built `baseDist/`/`dist/`, not the source.**
- `Makefile` — build orchestration for the SDK itself.
- `s9pk.mk`, `tsconfig.base.json` — build plumbing shipped *inside* the published package for service packages to `include`/`extends`. Marked DO NOT EDIT in the consuming-package contract; edits here change the contract for every package.
- `docs/` — the "Service Packaging" mdbook (`book.toml`), published at docs.start9.com/packaging. Has its own `docs/AGENTS.md`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — Keep a Changelog style, headings `## <sdk-version> — StartOS <os-version> (<date>)`.

## Build & test (run from `projects/start-sdk/`)

| Command | What |
|---------|------|
| `make node_modules` | `npm ci` in both `base/` and `package/` |
| `make bundle` | full build: compile base→`baseDist/`, package→`dist/`, then `test` + `check-fmt` |
| `make baseDist` | compile base only |
| `make dist` | compile package (depends on base) |
| `make test` | jest in both packages |
| `make check` | `tsc --noEmit` in both packages |
| `make fmt` / `make check-fmt` | Prettier write / check on all `.ts` |
| `make link` | build + `npm link` from `dist/` for local package testing |
| `make publish` | build, then `npm publish` from `dist/` (`OTP=…` for 2FA) |

Tests are jest + ts-jest, Node only (no browser). Test files use `.test.ts`. The ExVer parser is generated from `base/lib/exver/exver.pegjs` via Peggy (`make` runs this for you).

## Gotchas

- **Bumping the version requires a CHANGELOG entry.** Edit `package/package.json` `version`, then add the heading + `### Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed` sections at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`. Reviews reject version bumps without it.
- **Don't bump if the current latest hasn't published to npm.** Edit the unpublished version in place (promote patch→minor if the change warrants).
- **Consumers read the built output.** After editing `base/`/`package/`, run `make baseDist dist` before checking web / container-runtime.
- **base vs package:** types/ABI/OS-bindings/low-level → `base/`; developer-facing wrappers/runtime helpers → `package/`. A new base export must be re-exported from `package/lib/index.ts` or exposed via `StartSdk.build()`.
- **OS bindings** (`base/lib/osBindings/`) mirror Rust types in `shared-libs/crates/start-core`; regenerate/update them when the Rust side changes.
- **Editing `s9pk.mk` / `tsconfig.base.json` changes every package's build** — they ship in the published package. Treat as a public contract.
- Prettier config (single quotes, no semis, trailing commas, 2-space, `arrowParens: avoid`) lives in each sub-package's `package.json`.

## Docs

`README.md` (overview + quickstart), `ARCHITECTURE.md` (modules + data flow), `CONTRIBUTING.md` (build/test/contribute), `CHANGELOG.md`, this file. The packaging mdbook in `docs/` is the developer-facing reference — update it when you change the SDK's developer surface. Keep all of these current in the same change that alters structure, conventions, build, or surface.
