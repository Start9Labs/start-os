# Container Runtime

Node.js/TypeScript runtime that runs inside each StartOS service's LXC container. It loads the service's JavaScript out of its s9pk package, manages subcontainers, and brokers JSON-RPC calls between the service and the StartOS host daemon.

Every service container boots from the same base image; the per-service behavior comes entirely from the JavaScript loaded out of `javascript.squashfs` inside the s9pk and from container images mounted under `/media/startos/`.

This is a sub-component of the **start-os** product in the Start9 monorepo. The host-side daemon that drives it lives in `shared-libs/crates/start-core` (the `start_core` Rust library); the `start-container` binary that supervises this process is built from package `start-os`.

## Where it fits

This runtime lives at `projects/start-os/container-runtime` — the Node service runtime sub-component of the **start-os** product. It is driven over a Unix socket by the host daemon `start_core` (`shared-libs/crates/start-core`), supervised by the `start-container` binary built from package `start-os`, and consumes the runtime API from `@start9labs/start-sdk` (`projects/start-sdk`). For the overall monorepo layout see the root [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../../ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Documentation

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — runtime topology, the host/container RPC boundary, and the `/media/startos/` mount layout
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — local build, type-check, and test workflow
- `AGENTS.md` — practical build/test instructions and gotchas (also imported by `CLAUDE.md`)
- `RPCSpec.md` — full JSON-RPC protocol the runtime exposes over `service.sock`

## Quickstart

The runtime depends on the **built** SDK, referenced as `file:../../start-sdk/dist`, so build the SDK first:

```bash
cd projects/start-sdk && make bundle && cd -      # produces start-sdk/dist
npm --prefix projects/start-os/container-runtime ci
npm --prefix projects/start-os/container-runtime run check   # type-check
npm --prefix projects/start-os/container-runtime test        # jest
```

From the monorepo root you can also drive it through the top-level Makefile:

```bash
make test-container-runtime              # build SDK + run jest
```
