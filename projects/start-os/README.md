# StartOS

StartOS is an open-source Linux distribution for running a personal server. It
handles discovery, installation, network configuration, data backup, dependency
management, and health monitoring of self-hosted services. Services run in
isolated LXC containers, packaged as signed, merkle-archived `.s9pk` files.

This directory is the **StartOS OS product** within the monorepo. It is a thin
wrapper that ships the OS:

- the `startbox` daemon binary (`startd` / `start-cli` multi-call applet) and the
  `start-container` binary that runs inside each service LXC,
- the web UIs (`ui` = admin dashboard, `setup-wizard` = first-boot setup),
- the `container-runtime` (Node.js service runtime that runs inside package LXCs),
- the systemd units and OS image packaging glue.

The bulk of the backend logic lives in the shared `start-core` crate
(`../../shared-libs/crates/start-core`), and the Angular apps here consume the shared web
libraries under `../../shared-libs/ts-modules` and the SDK base from `../start-sdk`.

## Tech stack

- **Backend:** Rust (Tokio async, Axum), built on the `start-core` crate.
- **Frontend:** Angular 22 + Taiga UI 5 (apps live under `web/`, shared libs
  under `../../shared-libs/ts-modules`).
- **Container runtime:** Node.js/TypeScript managing LXC service containers.
- **State/sync:** Patch-DB (`../../shared-libs/crates/patch-db`) — diff-based store that pushes
  CBOR diffs to the frontend over WebSocket for reactive, poll-free UI updates.

OS-image packaging shared across products lives at the repo root: `debian/`
(maintainer scripts), `apt/`, `build/` (image-recipe, firmware, env scripts),
and `assets/`. The root `Makefile` drives the full ISO/img build.

## Quickstart

Build commands run from the **repo root** (one Cargo workspace, one Angular
workspace). See the [root CONTRIBUTING](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for full environment
setup (Debian/Ubuntu, Docker, Rust, Node 24).

```sh
# from the repo root
cargo check -p start-os                 # verify the OS bins compile
make ui                                  # build the admin UI
make all                                 # build everything for the current platform
make $(IMAGE_TYPE)                       # build the OS image (iso, or img on Pi)
```

`make` targets relevant to this product: `ui`, `uis`, `cli`, `cli-deb`, `install-cli`,
`deb`, `squashfs`, `update*`/`reflash`/`wormhole*` (deploy to a live device —
slow and destructive). Run `make test` for the full Rust + SDK + runtime test
suite.
