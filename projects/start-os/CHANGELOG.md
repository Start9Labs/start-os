# Changelog

All notable changes to the StartOS OS product are documented here. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and StartOS
uses an [extended version](https://docs.start9.com) of semantic versioning.

Full per-release notes are published on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Start9Labs/start-os/releases). This
file tracks notable changes since the move to the monorepo.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Migrated `startos-backup-fs` into the monorepo** as the `start-os/backup-fs`
  workspace member (from the former `Start9Labs/start-fs` repo); it is no longer
  built as an external `cargo install --git` dependency.
- **Monorepo reorganization.** `start-os` is now the monorepo for all Start9
  products. The OS product moved into its own `start-os/` directory as a thin
  wrapper: the `startbox` and `start-container` entry points live in
  `src/bin/`, the admin UI and setup wizard in `web/`, and the container runtime
  in `container-runtime/`. Backend logic moved from the old `core/` crate to the
  shared `start-core` crate (`shared-libs/crates/start-core`); shared Angular
  libraries moved to `shared-libs/web`; the SDK to `start-sdk`; and the `patch-db`
  submodule to `vendor/patch-db`. Builds now run against the root Cargo and
  Angular workspaces (`cargo build -p start-os`, web from `shared-libs/web`).

## [0.4.0-beta.10]

### Added

- **Automatic gateway configuration (#3306).** A StartOS server now opens its own public ports and publishes its private-domain DNS by talking to its gateway — a home router or a StartTunnel — instead of leaving it as a manual step.
  - **Automatic port forwarding.** When a public address needs a port open, StartOS opens it by speaking a port-control protocol to the gateway: PCP (RFC 6887) → NAT-PMP → UPnP IGD, in that order. Mappings are reference-counted, renewed with the forward, and withdrawn when the address is disabled or deleted. A single shared `PortMapController` also answers reachability, so `check_port` skips the remote echo probe when an automatic mapping is already active and reports the gateway-assigned external IP directly. Port mapping is scoped to the gateway each exposure actually routes through (the interface's own subnet gateway), so the box never probes an unrelated LAN router.
  - **Private-domain DNS injection (RFC 2136).** When a private domain is enabled on a gateway, StartOS pushes an `A` record (domain → this host's IP on that subnet) to the gateway's DNS server via DNS UPDATE so LAN devices that don't use StartOS's resolver can still resolve it, and withdraws it on disable/delete. `check_dns` now verifies a private domain by resolving the specific FQDN against the LAN's DNS server(s) and confirming it returns one of this server's LAN addresses.
  - **PCP HOSTNAME extension (SNI demux).** SSL/TLS services can share a single external port (443) across many hostnames: the gateway demultiplexes inbound TLS by SNI. StartOS emits PCP HOSTNAME mappings for public-domain vhosts (PCP-only — NAT-PMP/UPnP can't demux), gated by a PCP ANNOUNCE capability probe so the option is only sent to gateways that understand it. The protocol is documented as an Internet-Draft (`rfcs/draft-start9-pcp-hostname`).
  - **PCP PORT_SET (RFC 7753).** A contiguous port range maps in a single PCP MAP instead of per-port sweeps.
  - **In-place WireGuard gateway updates.** `start-cli net tunnel update <id> <config>` (and a per-gateway **Update config** UI action) re-issues a WireGuard config onto the existing interface without churning the gateway identity, so forwards and public/private domains keyed to it survive the swap — primarily to add a `DNS =` line to an existing config. The update path uses NetworkManager `Update2` + `Device.Reapply`, so updating the gateway carrying the request no longer drops its own transport.
  - **Best-effort 80→443 forward** so plain `http://` auto-redirects to `https` when a service is publicly exposed on 443.
- **Private domains on StartTunnel gateways (ba5396f49).** Now that a StartTunnel proxies DNS per subnet, a private domain resolves for tunnel clients (their DNS forwards to this server, which answers with the gateway's tunnel address), so the UI no longer restricts the public/private domain picker to router gateways — all gateways can use it. The "DNS Server Config" guidance is now gateway-aware: for a tunnel gateway it instructs you to point the StartTunnel subnet's DNS at this server. The private-domain and clearnet setup dialogs also surface the automatic alternatives (enable DNS Injection for the device; automatic UPnP/NAT-PMP/PCP port forwarding) instead of describing only the manual paths.
- **`MultiHost.bindPortRange` backend (#3270).** Host support for reserving a contiguous TCP+UDP port range (2–500 ports) in one call, stored as a single `RangeBindInfo` record under `Host.binding_ranges` and installed as one nftables rule per chain (via `PortForward.count`). Intended for real-time / WebRTC servers (coturn, RTP, SIP). Backed by the new `bindRange` effect.
- **Package init progress reporting (#3323).** A service can stream progress during the install/update finalization phase via the new `setInitProgress` effect; the host nests it inside the install's finalization phase using the standard `FullProgress` wire format, and `setupInit` auto-reports one step per composed init handler.
- **Phased backup progress (#3250).** `serverInfo.statusInfo.backupProgress` now uses the standard `FullProgress` shape (matching update/install progress). `NamedProgress.progress` is generalized to `PhaseProgress` so a phase can carry sub-phases, and the new `setBackupProgress` effect lets a service container stream its own backup sub-progress.
- **Backup format v2 (#3289).** Backups are written to a new `StartOSBackupsV2` directory, and the backup report now includes per-package duration. When a pre-v2 `StartOSBackups` folder is present on the selected target, the UI warns before backup — refusing if it won't fit in the remaining free space, otherwise confirming the format change (#3324, `backup.target.legacy-info` RPC).
- **Direct cross-package action runs via `access` (#3267).** Action metadata gains an `access` field (`'public' | 'dependent' | 'user'`, default `'user'`) controlling who may invoke an action directly through `effects.action.run`. Public/dependent actions give dependents a direct path instead of only creating a task; direct runs still honor the action's `visibility` and `allowedStatuses`.
- **`input-not-matches` tasks accept multiple values (#3310).** `TaskInput` splits into `accept` (a list of acceptable partial inputs) and `set` (the value to prefill when none match); the cross-package critical-conflict guard fires only when the input conflicts with every `accept` entry. The host still accepts the legacy `{ value }` shape over the effects socket for s9pks built on the pre-2.0 SDK.
- **Service interfaces tab.** Service interfaces are promoted to a dedicated sidebar tab; the dashboard interfaces card and per-interface detail route are removed, sidebar nav labels are decoupled from route paths, and the tasks table is redesigned (action-first, service rendered as an icon).
- **Unified marketplace + brochure.** The in-OS marketplace and the public brochure now share `@start9labs/marketplace` components behind an `AbstractMarketplaceService` (the OS persists to patch-db, the brochure to localStorage), so both ship the identical detail/preview UI. The brochure app is ported into the workspace and auto-deployed to `marketplace.start9.com` on master. The registry-selection modal is replaced by an inline registry-select dropdown (switch/add/delete inline), and custom registries can now be added by bare domain (https default; http for `.onion`) (#3349). Empty categories are hidden (snapping back to "all" on a registry switch that empties the selection), category icons are refreshed for the current set, and a "Package a service" link sits beneath the sidebar categories. See [`../brochure/CHANGELOG.md`](../brochure-marketplace/CHANGELOG.md) for the public site.
- **Nested idmapped mounts (#3248).** StartOS gains syscall-based mount primitives (`open_tree`/`move_mount`/`fsopen`/`mount_setattr`) and a `start-container mount` path, wiring up the SDK's `idmap` field on volume/asset/dependency/backup mounts end-to-end. See [`../start-sdk/CHANGELOG.md`](../start-sdk/CHANGELOG.md) for the SDK-facing surface.
- **Raspberry Pi image hardening (#3249).** Vendor kernel bumped to 6.18.33+rpt with apt pins so `/boot` stays vendor-only, `earlycon` for first-boot diagnostics, a loop-safe self-diagnosing `init_resize`, and data-drive-only setup for pre-installed devices.
- **Graceful shutdown on external power events (#3319).** Two systemd pre-shutdown barrier units (`startos-shutdown.service` / `startos-restart.service`) call `start-cli server shutdown/restart` and wait for graceful container teardown, so externally-initiated shutdowns (UPS / `qm` / ACPI) tear services down cleanly. The shutdown/restart RPC gains an opt-in `wait` param.
- **iOS root-CA install via configuration profile (#3240).** A new endpoint serves an unsigned Apple Configuration Profile (`PayloadType com.apple.security.root`); iOS/iPadOS download links are UA-sniffed and routed to `.mobileconfig`, fixing the broken `.crt` install flow on iOS 26.5 Safari.
- **`diagnose-hang` capture script (#3236).** Captures startd runtime state entirely via `/proc` and basic tools (per-thread kernel stacks, fds/sockets, journal tail, dmesg, disk health, lxc status) when startd is unresponsive and `start-cli` can't help.
- **`lo` and `lxcbr0` treated as secure networks (#3297)** for insecure (plain-HTTP) traffic, since loopback and the container bridge never leave the host; an explicit secure setting still overrides the intrinsic default.

### Changed

- **Firewall migrated from iptables to native nftables (5b9cf7313).** Every StartOS-managed rule now lives in a single `table ip startos` with stable comment tags for handle-based, idempotent teardown (per-forward DNAT/hairpin/masquerade, the FORWARD `policy drop`, lxcbr0 container-egress accept, and the mangle policy-routing marks). lxc-net and wg-quick keep their own iptables-nft rules in separate tables. The `nftables` package is added to dependencies.
- **Manifest capability flags split (#3271, #3275).** The misleading `nestedRuntime` flag is replaced by two independent capabilities: `userspaceFilesystems` (mounts `/dev/fuse` for fuse-overlayfs storage) and `virtualNetworking` (mounts `/dev/net/tun` for VPN / WireGuard / tun workloads). Both are device grants only — the service LXC already retains `CAP_NET_ADMIN` within its user namespace via the standard `userns.conf` include, so no capability machinery is needed (an earlier `lxc.cap.drop` snippet that was wrongly framed as "re-granting `CAP_NET_ADMIN`" — and actually dropped five caps that were otherwise kept — was removed). Hard rename — packages using `nestedRuntime` must republish.
- **Service-container memory isolation (#3304).** Every service container is placed in a `services.slice` opted into systemd-oomd PSI monitoring, capped at total RAM minus a fixed 1 GiB host reservation; `system.slice`/`user.slice` get `MemoryMin` floors. A burst of concurrent installs can no longer overcommit RAM and wedge the host.
- **Container-runtime RPC/action logging is gated behind a dev build (#3325)** — production builds no longer log full RPC inputs/responses (which can contain action secrets) to service logs.
- **Web platform upgraded to Angular 22, TypeScript 6, and Taiga UI 5.11**, with a unified, version-pinned Prettier config enforced in CI.
- **SDK 2.0.0** ships alongside this release (see [`../start-sdk/CHANGELOG.md`](../start-sdk/CHANGELOG.md)); StartOS 0.4.0-beta.10 is its minimum host version.
- Backup progress is surfaced as a dialog with a percentage rather than a notification.

### Fixed

- **Split DNS for dual public/private domains (#3263).** A domain configured as both private (e.g. on Ethernet) and public (on a StartTunnel) is now served as private DNS to LAN clients, gated per-gateway in the resolver, instead of falling through to the upstream forwarder and hairpin-routing to the public VPS IP.
- **DNS `[::]:53` wildcard listener (#3346).** DNS listeners bind with `SO_REUSEPORT` so the dual-stack catch-all coexists with the per-address sockets; previously the catch-all's TCP bind failed with `EADDRINUSE` and was silently dropped.
- **Host address list renders instead of panicking (#3345)** — `start-cli` no longer hits `todo!()` displaying the server host address table.
- **Web server connections run in parallel with HTTP/2 adaptive window (#3328)**, fixing head-of-line stalls under load.
- **Logger writes moved off worker threads (#3259).** File/stderr log writes no longer hold a mutex across a blocking `stderr` write, which could park every tokio worker (and stall ports 80/443) if journald backpressured.
- **`create_task` self-deadlock during `setupInit` (#3273)** — a service calling `createOwnTask` with an `input-not-matches` trigger from its init handler no longer wedges in `updating`.
- **Replayed task state is preserved when the target service is unavailable (#3309)** — services running before shutdown no longer stay stopped after boot when a critical-severity task replays against a still-initializing dependency.
- **Stale mountpoints are reconciled before remount (#3314).** After a `SIGKILL` left kernel mounts in place, a same-boot restart now lazily unmounts the stale target instead of failing every service load with "already mounted".
- **`TMP_MOUNTS` self-deadlock on nested idmapped mounts** is avoided (5aee392a2).
- **Unmountable partitions are skipped when listing backup targets (#3237)** instead of aborting the listing.
- **Bind-mount source directories are auto-created via recursive canonicalize** (d8ae7f199), and mount propagation is corrected (27322b4a9).
- **`/media/startos` ownership on migrated installs (#3311, #3312).** A migration repairs the stale `root:root` overlay entry so migrated nodes match fresh installs (`root:startos`), letting the `start9` SSH user browse package data without sudo.
- **CA fingerprint hex bytes are zero-padded**, with a `0.4.0-beta.10` repair migration for affected installs.
- **`.onion` (Tor) and `.local` (mDNS) are routed correctly through the host SOCKS proxy** (b5dec33cf), and reaching a `.onion` registry without Tor now reports a clear error ("the Tor service is not installed / not running") instead of a generic connection failure.
- **`NetService` is torn down synchronously on container destroy (#3285)**, and the nftables/policy-routing reconcile is made atomic, idempotent, and lock-free (daeee4f12, cebd6d703, 3ee50b0c3).
- **A service with no active bindings no longer wedges shutdown/restart indefinitely (#3350).** After #3285 moved network teardown into the awaited container-destroy path, a no-op `clear_bindings` emitted no patch-db revision, so the convergence wait blocked forever — stalling reboots for a service accessed only over Tor. The teardown now skips the wait when nothing changed.
- **ACME issuance restored.** `async-acme` is re-pinned to keep its HTTP backend (#3342), and `ring` is installed as the process-default rustls provider so ACME cert acquisition no longer panics on the dual ring/aws-lc-rs build.
- **Union variant memory is isolated per row (#3337)**, disabled options render correctly in select dropdowns (#3229), and the per-row Wi-Fi overflow menu no longer disappears (#3243).
- **The redundant "Plugin:" prefix is dropped from interface plugin labels (#3349)** — the plugin address group already sits within a plugin section.
- **Login and CA-wizard UX cleanup (e86dcc242).** The login button uses an inline loading state that holds until navigation completes (replacing the global overlay loader) and is correctly centered; the CA wizard gets a solid card background, drops the redundant "Bookmark this page" step, and moves the "repeat on every device" caveat into a notification.
- **`fedimintd` → `fedimint-guardian`** package-ID rename is handled across all four `0.3.5.1`→`0.4.0` migration paths (2a806d8b8).

### Removed

- **Package `alerts` manifest field (BREAKING, #3333).** Packages can no longer define install / update / uninstall / restore / start / stop confirmation messages. StartOS stops reading and showing them; existing installs and old s9pks are unaffected (the field is ignored on load). Built-in confirmations for destructive actions are unchanged.
- **`nestedRuntime` manifest flag** — replaced by `userspaceFilesystems` / `virtualNetworking` (see _Changed_), with no compatibility alias.

### Security

- **TSIG-authenticated DNS UPDATE (#3306).** RFC 2136 injections are authenticated with TSIG (RFC 8945, HMAC-SHA256) keyed off a per-device key derived (HKDF-SHA256) from that device's WireGuard PSK, closing a forgery vector where any co-located service emitting from the server's tunnel IP could inject DNS.
- **Packages are blocked from port-mapping the gateway (#3306).** Only startd may send UPnP/NAT-PMP/PCP upstream; a dedicated nftables guard table drops these protocols when forwarded from any interface (LXC), so a service can't open ports on the upstream gateway.
- **Dependency/advisory cleanup:** resolved Dependabot alerts across core, web, and container-runtime (#3301); migrated to hickory 0.26 to clear DNS RUSTSEC advisories (#3302); resolved forked-dep RUSTSEC advisories in tokio-tar and async-acme (#3303).
