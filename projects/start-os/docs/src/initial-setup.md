1. Connect your server to power and Ethernet.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > **Always plug your server into a surge protector — never directly into the wall.** Power surges from lightning, utility events, or appliances on the same circuit can permanently damage your server's hardware and corrupt your data drive. A standard surge protector is the minimum; an [uninterruptible power supply (UPS)](surge-and-ups.md) is strongly recommended for added protection against brownouts and unexpected power loss.

1. From a computer connected to the same Local Area Network (LAN) as your server, open a browser and visit [http://start.local](http://start.local).

1. Select a setup option:
   - **Start fresh**: Select this option if you are setting up a new server.

   - **Restore from Backup**: Select this option _only_ if your existing StartOS data drive has been lost or corrupted. This is for disaster recovery only.

   - **Transfer**: Select this option if you are transferring your existing data from one drive to another.

1. Set a strong master password. _Make it good. Write it down_. Resetting your password is non-trivial, but your data will be preserved.

1. Set your [server name](server-name.md). Your server's [mDNS address](mdns.md) is derived from this name.

1. Once initialization completes, open your server's permanent local address, then follow the instructions for [Trusting your Root CA](./trust-ca.md) to establish a secure connection with your server.
