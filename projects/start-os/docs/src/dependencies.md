# Dependencies

Dependencies are other services that a service requires or can optionally integrate with. They are listed on the service details page.

## Required vs Optional

- **Required** — The service cannot function without this dependency. It must be installed and running. For example, a Lightning node requires a Bitcoin node.
- **Optional** — The service works without this dependency but gains additional features when it is installed. For example, installing Tor service means Bitcoin can connect to peers over Tor.

## What Happens Automatically

When you install a service, StartOS checks its dependencies. If a required dependency is not installed, you will be prompted to install it. StartOS also monitors version compatibility — if a dependency is installed but running an incompatible version, you will be notified.

## Configuring Dependencies

Some dependencies need to be configured to work with the services that depend on them. When this is the case, a [task](tasks.md) will appear on the dashboard guiding you through the necessary steps. These tasks often link directly to an [action](actions.md) on the dependency, with form fields pre-filled to simplify configuration.

## Service Communication

Once dependencies are installed and configured, services communicate with each other automatically over the local network. No manual networking setup is required.
