# Flavors

Flavors are different services that share the same package ID. They are different implementations of the same protocol and data schema — for example, Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots. Because they share the same data schema, flavors tend to satisfy the same dependent services, such as a lightning node or an Electrum server.

## Version Format

Flavor versions are designated by their exver prefix: `#flavor:upstream-semver:downstream-semver`. For more details on version formatting, see [Versions](/packaging/src/versions.md).

## Limitations

It is not supported to install multiple flavors of the same service simultaneously. However, you can switch between them.

## Switching Flavors

To switch from one flavor to another:

1. Go to the [Marketplace](marketplace.md).
1. Find and view the listing for the flavor you want to switch to.
1. Instead of an **Install**, **Update**, or **Downgrade** button, you will see a **Switch** button. Click it to switch.
