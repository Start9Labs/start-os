# Private Domains

A private domain works like your server's [mDNS address](mdns.md), except it also works over [VPN](inbound-vpn.md) and it can be _anything_. It can be a real domain you control, a made up domain, or even a domain controlled by someone else.

Private domains can be added to any gateway: wired (Ethernet), wireless (WiFi), or WireGuard ([StartTunnel](/start-tunnel/)). They can only be accessed when connected to the same network as your server — your LAN, or a VPN / tunnel — and they require trusting your server's Root CA.

## Adding a Private Domain

> [!NOTE]
> How a private domain is made to resolve depends on the gateway type. On an **Ethernet** or **WiFi** gateway, you point your router's DNS at this server. On a **WireGuard ([StartTunnel](/start-tunnel/))** gateway, you either enable **DNS Injection** for this server in StartTunnel or point the tunnel subnet's DNS at this server. See [DNS for Private Domains](#dns-for-private-domains) below.

1. For an Ethernet or WiFi gateway, assign a static IP address to your server on the LAN if you haven't already (refer to your router's user manual). A WireGuard gateway already uses a fixed tunnel address, so this step does not apply.

1. On the service interface page, click "Add Domain" on the desired gateway table and select "Private Domain".

1. Enter a fully qualified domain name. It can be _anything_. For example: `domain.com`, `private.domain.internal`, `nextcloud.private`, `nextcloud.fake-tld`, or `facebook.com`.

1. Click "Save".

1. StartOS will automatically test your DNS configuration. If the test passes, the domain is ready to use. If it fails, a setup modal will appear with instructions to configure your DNS server and the ability to re-test.

## DNS for Private Domains

A private domain resolves only when the gateway's DNS serves its record. StartOS tests this automatically when you add a private domain and guides you through the setup if needed. How you configure it depends on the gateway type.

### Ethernet & WiFi gateways

Set StartOS as your router's primary DNS server. All routers support this feature. Refer to your router's user manual for detailed instructions.

> [!WARNING]
> It is possible that StartOS is already using your router for DNS. In this case, you cannot instruct your router to use StartOS for DNS, as this would be circular. If StartOS detects a potential circular DNS situation, it will warn you. To resolve this, switch to [static DNS servers](dns.md#static-dns-servers) so StartOS no longer relies on your router.

### WireGuard (StartTunnel) gateways

StartTunnel runs the DNS resolver for the tunnel, so you have two options:

- **DNS Injection** (simplest): in StartTunnel, enable the **DNS Injection** toggle for this server. StartOS then publishes the domain's record directly to StartTunnel's resolver — there is nothing else to configure.
- **Point the subnet at this server**: in StartTunnel, set the DNS for this server's subnet to this server's tunnel address. StartTunnel then forwards DNS for the subnet to StartOS.

> [!TIP]
> If your private domain is a real domain that you control, you can alternatively configure its DNS record at your registrar to resolve to your server's address on that network — its _LAN IP address_ for an Ethernet or WiFi gateway, or its _tunnel address_ for a WireGuard gateway. In this case, the StartOS DNS server is not needed.

## Split DNS: the Same Domain, Public and Private

You can add the _same_ domain as both a [clearnet](clearnet.md) (public) domain on a StartTunnel gateway and a private domain on an Ethernet or WiFi gateway. StartOS serves it as split DNS:

- When you are on your LAN or connected over [VPN](inbound-vpn.md), StartOS resolves the domain to your server's local IP address, so traffic stays on your network at full LAN speed.
- When you are away, the same domain resolves through public DNS to your StartTunnel gateway, so the service is reachable over the internet.

It's the same domain and the same TLS certificate either way, with no [hairpin routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairpinning) (LAN traffic looping out to the gateway and back).

> [!TIP]
> This is especially useful for services that embed their access URL in generated links, such as Nextcloud or Immich share links. Configure the service with the public domain so the links work for external recipients, and you'll still get direct LAN-speed access when you're home.
