# Flashing Firmware - Server Pure

This page is for the Server Pure _only_. It will not work on other devices.

Generally, you do not need to manually flash your device using this guide, as the firmware is now automatically updated on supported devices. Please only use this method if directed by a Start9 Support Technician. **If you were told to "_flash your device_", you are looking for the StartOS flashing guides instead.**

## Required Equipment

- A monitor and keyboard.
- A USB stick, formatted FAT32.

## Firmware Flashing Steps

1. Power down your server if not already.

1. Connect a monitor and keyboard to your server using two of the USB3 (blue) ports.

1. Download the right firmware:
   - Models without WiFi - [Download Standard](https://source.puri.sm/firmware/releases/-/blob/75631ad6dcf7e6ee73e06a517ac7dc4e017518b7/librem_mini_v2/custom/pureboot-librem_mini_v2-basic_usb_autoboot-Release-29.zip)
   - Models with WiFi - [Download Standard](https://source.puri.sm/firmware/releases/-/blob/75631ad6dcf7e6ee73e06a517ac7dc4e017518b7/librem_mini_v2/custom/pureboot-librem_mini_v2-basic_usb_autoboot-Release-29.zip) | [Download Jailed WiFi](https://source.puri.sm/firmware/releases/-/blob/75631ad6dcf7e6ee73e06a517ac7dc4e017518b7/librem_mini_v2/custom/pureboot-librem_mini_v2-basic_usb_autoboot_blob_jail-Release-29.zip)

   > [!NOTE]
   > The Jailed WiFi variation deactivates WiFi at the firmware level so it can never be turned on

1. Eject the USB stick and insert it into your server using a USB3 (blue) slot.

1. Turn on the server while pressing the `ESC` key on the keyboard repeatedly until you see the PureBoot Basic Boot Menu screen. Select "Options -->".
