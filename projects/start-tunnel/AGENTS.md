# AGENTS.md — start-tunnel

Practical instructions for working on the StartTunnel product inside the
`start-os` monorepo. Read the root `AGENTS.md` for monorepo-wide conventions
first; this file is scoped to `start-tunnel/`.

## What this project is

A WireGuard virtual private router with kernel-level clearnet port forwarding.
This directory is a **thin wrapper**: the binary entry point, the Angular UI, the
systemd unit, and the docs. The real logic lives in
`shared-libs/crates/start-core/src/tunnel/` (the `start_core::tunnel` module) and the
entry/CLI dispatch in `shared-libs/crates/start-core/src/bins/tunnel.rs`.

## Layout

- `src/main.rs` — embeds the UI, enables `start-tunnel`/`start-tunneld`, dispatches
  to `start-core`. Rarely needs changes.
- `Cargo.toml` — crate `start-tunnel`, bin `tunnelbox`. Depends on `start-core`.
- `start-tunneld.service` — systemd unit running `/usr/bin/start-tunneld`.
- `web/` — Angular project `start-tunnel` (registered in `shared-libs/web/angular.json`).
- `docs/` — mdbook (book title "StartTunnel"), output to `docs/book`.

| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| API methods / RPC commands           | `shared-libs/crates/start-core/src/tunnel/api.rs`                |

| WireGuard behavior                   | `shared-libs/crates/start-core/src/tunnel/wg.rs`                 |
| Port forwarding (DNAT, SNI, IGD/PCP) | `shared-libs/crates/start-core/src/tunnel/forward/`             |
| HTTPS / cert handling                | `shared-libs/crates/start-core/src/tunnel/web.rs`               |
| daemon startup / shutdown            | `shared-libs/crates/start-core/src/bins/tunnel.rs`              |
| the UI                               | `web/src/`                                                  |

Almost all backend work happens in `start-core`, not here. The one tunnel-local
Rust file is `src/main.rs`.

## Build & test (run from repo root)

```bash
make tunnel                                   # build tunnelbox (UI + daemon)
cargo build -p start-tunnel --bin tunnelbox   # cargo only (UI must be prebuilt)
cargo check -p start-tunnel                    # fast type-check
npm --prefix shared-libs/web run build:tunnel       # build just the Angular UI
make tunnel-deb                                # build the .deb
make test-core                                 # backend tests (tunnel logic lives in start-core)
```

Notes:
- `cargo check`/`cargo build` here only cover the linux target. The CI matrix
  also builds `*-apple-darwin` and `riscv64`/`aarch64` musl — platform-specific
  code (`libc`, resolv-conf, etc.) can pass locally and break darwin. cfg-gate
  platform-only paths; don't reimplement them cross-platform.
- `make tunnel` needs the static UI at `web/dist/static/start-tunnel/index.html`;
  the Makefile target chains the UI build → `compress-uis.sh` automatically.
- TS bindings for the tunnel API regenerate via `make ts-bindings` into
  `shared-libs/crates/start-core/bindings/tunnel/`.

## Format

```bash
make format          # formats the whole repo
make format-check    # CI check
```

Rust: `cargo fmt` (edition 2024). Web: prettier via the shared Angular config.

## Gotchas

- **One binary, three names.** `tunnelbox` is multi-call; it's installed as
  symlinks `start-tunneld` (daemon), `start-tunnel` (CLI), and `tunnelbox`. The
  active subcommand is chosen by `argv[0]`.
- **Default listen** is `127.0.59.60:5960` (`TUNNEL_DEFAULT_LISTEN` in
  `tunnel/mod.rs`). HTTPS is added/removed reactively from the `/webserver` db
  path — no restart on toggle.
- **State is PatchDB.** Changes are JSON patches; the daemon subscribes to db
  paths and reconciles kernel state (WireGuard, iptables). Schema changes need a
  numbered migration in `tunnel/migrations/` and registration in `mod.rs`.
- **Runtime deps.** The daemon shells out to `wireguard-tools`, `iptables`,
  `nftables`, and `conntrack`; the `.deb` declares them. Adding a new external
  tool means updating the `DEPENDS=` list in the Makefile `tunnel-deb` target.
- **Port forwarding is Layer 3/4.** It rewrites IP headers (DNAT) and does not
  decrypt payloads — keep it that way; TLS terminates at the user's service.
- **CLI and UI share `tunnel_api()`.** Add a method once in `api.rs`; both
  surfaces get it.
- **Version bump:** `Cargo.toml` `version` carries a `# VERSION_BUMP` marker —
  bump it there.
- **Manpages** for `start-tunnel` are generated (and committed) into this
  project's `man/` dir by `cargo test -p start-core export_manpage_start_tunnel`
  (the generator lives in `start-core`'s `bins/tunnel.rs`).

## Docs are part of the change

User-facing changes (UI, CLI flags/output, install flow, subnet/device/forward
behavior) must update `docs/src/` in the same change. The mdbook is published at
`start9.com/start-tunnel/`. Reference: `docs/src/cli-reference.md`,
`installing.md`, `subnets.md`, `devices.md`, `port-forwarding.md`.
