  '/lan/ipv4': `## LAN – IPv4

### Network Block

The /16 private IP block for your network. Each security profile will receive its own /24 subnet within this block, allowing up to 256 separate subnets with 254 devices each.

### Router IP

The address assigned to your router within the default subnet (.0.x). This is the address devices use to reach the router and access the internet.`,
  '/lan/ipv6': `## LAN – IPv6

### IPv6

When enabled, devices on your network will receive IPv6 addresses via SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration). This is the standard method for IPv6 address assignment.

IPv6 allows your devices to be directly reachable from the internet without NAT, which is useful for hosting services or peer-to-peer applications.

### Prefix Length

The prefix length determines the size of your LAN's IPv6 address space. It must be **larger** (a higher number) than your WAN prefix to create a valid subnet.

For example, if your ISP assigns you a /48 prefix, you can use /56, /60, or /64 for your LAN. A /64 prefix is recommended for most home networks.`,
  '/outbound': `## Outbound VPNs

Outbound VPNs route your internet traffic through encrypted tunnels to remote servers, enhancing privacy and security.

### Why use outbound VPNs?

-   Hide your IP address from websites and services
-   Encrypt traffic on untrusted networks
-   Access geo-restricted content
-   Prevent ISP tracking

### VPN Chaining

Route one VPN through another for additional privacy. Your traffic exits through multiple servers, making it harder to trace back to you. Note that chaining increases latency.

### Getting Started

Upload a WireGuard configuration file from your VPN provider (Mullvad, ProtonVPN, IVPN, etc.) to create a new VPN client.`,
  '/outbound/vpn': `## Outbound VPNs

<details><summary>Label</summary> A friendly name to identify this VPN connection. Use something descriptive like "Mullvad Sweden" or "Work VPN". </details> <details><summary>Connects to</summary> Where traffic from this VPN should be routed:<ul><li><b>Internet:</b> Traffic exits directly to the internet through this VPN.</li><li><b>Another VPN:</b> Chain through another VPN first for extra privacy. Your traffic will be encrypted multiple times and exit through multiple servers.</li></ul><b>Note:</b> Chaining VPNs increases latency and may reduce speeds. </details> <details><summary>Connection Path</summary> Shows the full route your traffic takes from this VPN to the internet. For example: Mullvad → Proton → Internet means traffic is encrypted by Mullvad, sent through Proton, then exits to the internet.</details>`,
  '/outbound/dialog': `## Outbound VPNs

VPN clients create an outbound connection to a VPN server, allowing devices to send and receive data as if they were directly connected to the private network. Masks your IP address, bypasses geographic restrictions, and protects sensitive data on public Wi-Fi networks.

### Label

A clear and descriptive name for the VPN connection, such as "Mullvad Sweden" or "Work VPN," to easily differentiate it from other connections.

### Config File

Upload a WireGuard **.conf** file from your VPN provider. This file contains the server address, keys, and connection settings needed to establish the tunnel. Most providers (Mullvad, ProtonVPN, IVPN, etc.) offer WireGuard config file downloads from their website or app.

### Target

The next hop in the path of a layered VPN connection.`,
  '/profiles': `## Profiles

Which DNS servers devices in this profile use — the system's ("System"), the profile's own custom servers ("Custom"), or, when routing through a VPN, the VPN's ("VPN").

### Outbound

How traffic from this profile reaches the internet — directly ("Direct"), or through one of your VPN clients (shown by name).

### LAN Access

Which other profiles this profile can communicate with on the local network — all of them, only its own, or a chosen whitelist.

### WAN Access

Whether devices in this profile have internet access, optionally restricted by a whitelist or blacklist of IP addresses or CIDR ranges.`,
  '/profiles/dialog': `## Profiles

Security profiles define network segments with isolated permissions. Each profile controls internet access and communication with other profiles on your local network.

### Name

A descriptive name for the security profile, such as "Guest" or "IoT Devices".

### Subnet

The third octet of the IPv4 subnet for this profile. For example, a value of 2 creates the subnet 192.168.2.0/24. Each profile must have a unique subnet.

### LAN Access

Controls which other profiles this profile can communicate with on the local network. Choose "All" for full access, "Same profile" for isolation, or "Whitelist" to select individual profiles.

### Auto whitelist new profiles

When LAN access is set to "Whitelist", enabling this also grants access to any profiles created in the future — useful for admin profiles that should reach all network segments.

### Outbound Routing

Choose how traffic from this profile reaches the internet. Select "Direct" for normal internet access, or "VPN" to route all of the profile's traffic through one of your VPN clients.

### WAN Access

Whether devices in this profile have internet access. Use "Whitelist" or "Blacklist" to restrict access to specific IP addresses or CIDR ranges, or "None" to block the internet entirely.

### Blackout Schedule

Designated times when WAN (internet) access is blocked for devices on this profile. Outside of these windows the profile's normal WAN access rules apply. For example, a "Kids" profile might block WAN access at 7 PM on school nights and 9 PM on weekends, while an "Admin" profile retains full 24/7 access.

This section is disabled when WAN access is set to "None" — the internet is already blocked at all times, so there is nothing to schedule. Any windows you've configured are kept and take effect again if you re-enable WAN access.

### DNS

Choose whether this profile uses the system's DNS servers or its own. Select "Custom" to specify up to three DNS servers, each with optional DoH (DNS over HTTPS) encryption for secure lookups.`,
  '/profiles/blackout': `## Profiles – Blackout times

A blackout window blocks WAN (internet) access for all devices on this profile during the specified time period. The profile's normal WAN access rules apply outside of blackout windows.

### Time Window

The start and end times for the blackout period. WAN access will be blocked between these times on the selected days. Set an end time earlier than the start to wrap the window past midnight (e.g. 22:00–06:00), or set the end equal to the start to block the full 24 hours.

### Days

Select which days of the week the blackout window should be active.`,
  '/profiles/schedule': `### Blackout Schedule

Designated times when WAN (internet) access is blocked for devices on this profile. Outside of these windows the profile's normal WAN access rules apply.
