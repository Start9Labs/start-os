# Shared Libraries

Cross-product shared code for the Start9 monorepo. Everything here is consumed by
the thin product crates/apps at `projects/` (`projects/start-os/`,
`projects/start-cli/`, `projects/start-registry/`, `projects/start-tunnel/`,
`projects/start-sdk/`, `projects/brochure-marketplace/`); little ships from
here on its own.

## Layout

- **`crates/start-core/`** — the entire Rust backend, packaged as the `start-core`
  crate (lib name `start_core`). Every product binary (`startbox`/`start-container`,
  `start-cli`, `registrybox`, `tunnelbox`) depends on it. See
  [`crates/start-core/README.md`](crates/start-core/README.md).

- **`ts-modules/`** — shared TypeScript modules; currently two publishable
  Angular libraries built through the single Angular workspace rooted at the repo
  root (`angular.json`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`):
  - `ts-modules/shared/` → `@start9labs/shared` (API clients, components, i18n, styles)
  - `ts-modules/marketplace/` → `@start9labs/marketplace` (service discovery UI)

  The product apps (`projects/start-os/web/ui`, `projects/start-os/web/setup-wizard`,
  `projects/start-tunnel/web`, `projects/brochure-marketplace/src`) all live in their
  product dirs but build through this workspace and import these libraries. See
  [`ts-modules/README.md`](ts-modules/README.md).

## Quickstart

Rust backend:

```bash
# from the repo root
cargo build -p start-core            # build the shared lib
cd shared-libs/crates/start-core && cargo test
```

Web:

```bash
# from the repo root
npm ci
npm run build:deps                   # build start-sdk bundle + patch-db client
npm run check                        # typecheck all projects
```
