/**
 * A function that controls the polling interval of a health check.
 *
 * A trigger is an async iterator factory: it receives a `getInput` callback
 * that returns the latest {@link TriggerInput} (including the most recent
 * health check result), and yields once each time the health check should
 * run again. The time between yields determines the polling frequency.
 *
 * Most packages should use the built-in triggers (`sdk.trigger.*`) rather
 * than implementing this interface directly.
